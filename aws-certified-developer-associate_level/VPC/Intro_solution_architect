VPC:
- VPC instance can span across availability zone.
- it will not span across region.
- connection from external source should go through internet gateway to reach the vpc.
- create subnet before launching the instance in that vpc.

types of subnets
   - private subnets
       - does not have direct route to internet
   - public
       - have direct route to internet
       - eg: web application will be launched in public whereas db for that database will be launched in private subnet.

- another internet gateway types is virtual private gateway. we can make our hardware to be used and connect to your vpc.
- vpc is regional network.
- we can use internal dns or we can use dhcp.

benefits:
---------
- custom ip range inside each subnets
- configure routes between subnets via route tables.
- configure internet gateway to provide route to the internet for resources launched in vpc
- create layered network of resources.
- extends on-premise network into the cloud with VPN/VPG and an IPsec VPN tunnel
- layered Security
    - instance level security group(firewall on the instance level)
    - subnet level network ACL(firewall on the subnet level)

VPC IP Addressing:
====================
- IPV4 range from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255  [ 32 bit and 4-8 bit octets] [ private and public address]
- IPV6 128 bits . 8 - 4chr hexadecimal  [public only]
- aws supports IPV6 & IPv4
- CIDR(classlist inter domain routing)
     - 10.0.0.0/16 corresponds to range of 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.255.255  [ 65536 addresses]
         - first 16 bits are fixed out of 32 bits.
     - 10.0.0.0/24 corresponds to range of 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.0.255 [ 256 addresses]
     - 10.0.0.0/32 corresponds to 10.0.0.0 [1 addresses]
     - 0.0.0.0/0  corresponds to range of 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255 [ entire internet]

Default VPC:
=============
- it comes preconfigured with aws account when it is created.
- default vpc has different setup than non-default vpc
- default vpc has easy access to vpc without having to configure it from scratch.
- default vpc, all subnet have route to internet via route table and an attached IGW.
- instance launched in default vpc has both private and public ip.


Route table:
==============
- route table consists of set of rules called routes used to determine where network traffic is directed.
- consists of two main componenets:
   - Destination : CIDR block range of the target
   - Target : A name identifier of where the data is being routed to.
- By default, all subnet traffic is allowed to each other available subnet within your VPC which is called local route.
- cannot modify local route.
- unlike IGW, we can have multiple "active" route tables in VPC.
- cannot delete route table if it has dependencies.
- best practice is to leave the default route table and create new route table when new routes are needed for specific subnets.

VPC Networking routing basics:
===============================
- create vpc
  - go to vpc dashboard
  - select "Create VPC"
  - enter name & ipv4 cidr block & click "create"
- attached internet gateway to vpc
  - select internet gateway in vpc dashboard.
  - select "create internet gateway"  , enter name and click "create"
  - attach the internet gateway to the vpc
  - click the name of the igw and select "Actions -> attach to VPC -> select vpc" & attach.
- create subnets
  - "Create subnet" , enter name, select VPC, AZ, CIDR -> click "Create"
  - by default all subnets are private becaz we have not associated with route table.
- create route tables
  - click "Route Table" , enter name and select VPC -> "Create"
  - select "Route" -> Edit -> ADd another route -> Add destination[0.0.0.0/0] & enter igw name -> Save
  - Select "Subnet Assocations" -> Edit -> select subnets -> Save


  VPC Security Basics:
  ======================
  - First level of security is network access control list(ACLs) which operate at subnet level.
  - If request pass the ACLs , then it will go to security groups for next level of security check.
  Network Access Control List(NACL):
   - By default ACL allow all traffic. Add custom firewall rule to block the traffic.
   - ACLs essentials:
    - support allow and deny rules for traffic in and out of subnet
    - they are stateless. so return traffic must be allowed through outbound rule.
    - process rules in number order when deciding whether to allow or deny
    - if traffic denied at lower number rule and allowed at higher number rule, the allow rule will be ignored and traffic will be denied.
    - last rule in every ACL is "Catch all" deny rule. (unless protocol/port is explicitly allowed, it will be denied.)
    - NACL is optional layer of security for you VPC  that acts as firewall.
    - best practice is to increment numbers by 10 so if you have to place rule in certain order, it will not cause issue.
  Security Groups:
   - second level of security.
   - security group are stateful. so, we dont have to worry about outbound rules. Only inbound rules should suffice.
   - it supports only allow rules
   - all rules are evaluated before deciding the allow traffic.
   - best practice is to allow only traffic that is required.
   - it is associated at instance level.
   - same security group can be used by more than instance.
