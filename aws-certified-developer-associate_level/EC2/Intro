EC2(Elastic compute cloud)
  - virtual cloud instance.
  - scalability(create/terminate on the fly)
  - security group must be assigned to the ec2 instance.
  - Hypervisor is the software which gives virtual instance to different customer from the single/same host server.


EC2 Instance option:
  - on-demand
  - reserved
  - spot instances
  - free tier

Instance size:
  -  micro
  - small
  - large
  - medium



pricing:
  -  data transfer
  - Storage
  - compute
  - elastic ip
  - monitoring
  - elastic load balancer
  - free tier

Storage:
  - Instant stores
  - EBS(elastic block storage)

EC2
  - each instance is assigned with public & private ip address, public cname

Maintaining session state on ELB(elastic load balancer):
  - session are stores as file based session

AMI'S & Virtualisation:
========================

AMI:
   - preconfigured package required to launch ec2 instance consists of OS, s/w packages, other required settings.
   - used with auto scaling to quickly launch the new instance.
   - we can create our own AMI's
   - AMI types
      - Community AMI (free to use)
      - AWS market place ami(pay to use)
      - My AMI (our own ami)

Virtualisation:
   - creating virtual version of something rather than actual version.
   - portion of server's computing power and storage.
   - Virtualisation for ec2 is run using xen Hypervisor software.
   - Virtualisation types
       -  HVM AMI(hardware virtual machine)
          - run an operating system directly on top of virtual machine without any modifications.
          - ec2 host system emulates some or all underlying hardware
          - has advantage of hardware extensions
       - PV AMI(paravirtual)
          - guests can run on host hardware does not have explicit support for Virtualisation
          - they cannot have hardware extensions.
          - PV guests has better perfomance than HVM.

EC2 instance types:
=====================
  - all ec2 in aws using intel zion processor.
  - Processor features:
      - AVX - highly parallel HPC workloads.
      - AES-NI accelerated enc/decryption.
      - Transactional sync extensions
      - P & C states - tune perfomance and sleep state.
      - Turboboost - over clocking.

      - Instance types:
        - general purpose (M)
        - compute optimised (C)
        - memory optimised (R/X)
        - GPU (G/P)
        - storage optimized (H)
        - IO optimised (I)
        - Burstable (T) [ will not give dedicated virtual server/ shared cpu]

Launch EC2 Instance:
=====================

Ip Address:
   Private IP:
     - ec2 defauts assigned with private ip
     - used to internal communication within instance(within vpc)
   Public IP:
     - has option to enable to public ip(auto-assign)
     - direct communication with resource in open internet.
   Elastic IP:
     - static & public IPv4 address , designed for dynamic cloud computing.
     - with eip, we can attach public ip addess to ec2 that was created only with private ip.
     - attaching EIP will replace the default public ip address.
     - if we stop  & start the instance, public ip will be changed whereas EIP will remains same.
Bootstrapping & user data
   - self starting process or set of commands without external input
   - User data
       - step/section during the EC2 instance creation process where we can include our custom commands.
       - to view the user data in ec2 instance, enter the following commands
            curl http://160.12.12.12/latest/user-data/
            curl http://160.12.12.12/latest/meta-data/

EC2 Storage Options:
======================
 - Instance store
     - mounted on the host server.
     - local Storage
     - Faster IOPS
     - Data will be lost if we terminate the instance.
 - EBS(elastic block storage)
     - outside of the host machine.
     - virtual disk
     - access over the network
     - take snapshot frequently to save the data.
     - EBS optimised (will not use the regular network for the file transfer). current gen ebs has these features.
     - persistent(they can live beyond the lifecycle of ec2)
     - EBS performance:
        - IO operations are measured in IOPS(IO per sec)
        - AWS measures IOPS in 256 kb chunks
        - Operations greater than 256KB as divided into individual 256kb chunks.
     - EBS Types:
        - SSD
           - general purpose
              - use for dev environment
              - baseline performance 3 IOPS/Gib
              - Bursts upto 3000 IOPS
              - volume size 1Gib to 1TiB
           - Provisioned IOPS SSD
              - used for mission critical applications
              - volume size 4Gib to 16TiB
              - upto 32000 IOPS per volume
              - ec2 instance can have max of 80000 IOPS total.
        - Hard Disk Drives
           - Throughput Optimised
              - low storage cost.
              - volume size 500Gib - 16TiB
              - Max Throughput of 500 MiB/s
              - ec2 have max Throughput of 1750 MiB/s
           - Coldest HDD
              - Lowest cost.
              - volume size 500Gib - 16 tib
              - max Throughput of 250 MiB/s
 - EFS(elastic file system)
     - sharing file across ec2 machine.


Security Groups and Keys Pairs:
=================================


Tags:
  - we can use this to name the resource and group them together by project or for billing purposes(cost based on tags).
  - can have 50 tags per ec2 instance.
Security groups:
  - every ec2 instance will have atleast 1 security group.
  - security groups will be shared by multiple instance.
  - Create a new security group.
     - enter name & desc
     - select "Add Rule"
     - add rule using ssh,http,https and select your required ip Address
Key pair:
  - consists of private and public key.
  - used to ssh to that instance.
  - donwloaded key pair has private part of the key.
  - public key is automatically copied to the ec2 instance when launched.
  - on linux default user is ec2_user. for ubuntu its ubuntu.
  - chmod 400 to pem file
  - ssh -i pem.txt ec2-user@publicip

EBS Snapshots:
================
- Snapshots are incremental in nature.
- used to create custom ami's.
- recommended to take snapshot frequently.
- data in memory will not be written to snapshot.
- fsfreeze to stop writes and issue snapshot command to start the snapshot.
- EC2 -> Elastic block store -> volume -> actions -> create snapshots

EC2 Placement groups:
=======================
cluster placement groups
  - cluster of instance in the same availability zone.
  - used for application required extremely low latency.
  - aws attempts to place all instance as close as possible.
  - its recommended to launch all instance in placement groups in single shot becaz later slots may not be available in that machine.
  - it is possible to add instance to the placement group after launching the placement group.
Spread placement groups
  - place instance on distinct host hardware.

- Create placement group steps
   EC2 -> network & security -> placement groups -> create placement group -> enter name & select strategy -> create
   - while launching instances select this placement group.
- no additional charge for placement group.
