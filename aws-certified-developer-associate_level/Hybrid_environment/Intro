VPN:
========
- extend the network from one geographic location to another geographic location.
- traffic traverses the internet.
- essentially extending "on-premise" network to the cloud.
- allows to communicate all resouces(ec2) internally without the need of public ip and internet gateway.
- provide additional level of security that traffic sent using vpn is encrypted.
- it has two parallel routes (Ipsec tunnels) which is for redundancy.
- Only one vpn can be attached to VPC. only one IGW can be attached to VPC.
- vpc can have both vpg and igw attached at the same time.
- from the user end its connection start from "Customer Gateway" and reach the VPC through "Internet Gateway"/"Virtual Private Gateway"
- both customer gateway and VPG should have public ip address.
- we can have more than one customer gateway

Internet protocol security(IPsec)
  - security protocol for IPv4.
  - provide mutual authentication, encryption

Customer Gateway:
- Physical device present in the "on-premise" location acts as a connector to VPN location.
- Customer Gateway Component:
    - configure the public ip of the device at the on-premise location.
- static Routing - we define routes
- dynamic routing - routes automatically, automatic failover.
  - border gateway protocol.
  - autonomous system number.

Virtual Private Gateway:
- acts as a connection of VPC side.
- VPG is connected to vpc
- target for route tables.
- Cloud Hub - multiple customer network.

VPN Connection:
- Connection between customer gateway and virtual private gateway
- connection is setup and managed by AWS
- each connection uses two IPsec tunnels for redundancy

Router:
- User can Physically setup and manage router.
- route tables are part of router assigned to vpc
- when setting up VPN, route table should have ip of on-premise network and point them to VPG.


AWS Direct Connect:
======================
- service that provide dedicated network Connection between your network and aws direct connect location.
- this is done through authorized direct connect provider.
   1 Gbps or 10 Gbps
- dedicated network can be shared by multiple companies.
- provides ability to access vpc in the aws region it is associated with.
- access to public service endpoints in all regions.

Benefits:
  - Reduce network costs
    - reduce bandwidth commitment to corporate ISP over public internet.
    - data transferred over direct connect is billed at lower rate by aws.
  - increase network consistency
    - dedicated Private network reduce Latency
  - connect the direct connect connection to VPG in you VPC for a dedicated private connection from on premise to VPC.
  - use multiple VIF (virtual interface) to connect to multiple VPCs.

Private Virtual Interface(VIF):
  - allows to interface with AWS VPC.
  - only communicate within internal IP addresses inside EC2.
  - cannot access public IP
  - use two direct connection for active-active and active-failover connection.
  - use VPC as a backup for direct connect connection.
  - can create multiple private virtual interface to multiple VPC at the same time.

Public Virtual Interface:
  - allows to use the direct connect connection to connect to public endpoints(S3, dynamodb)
  - though accessing public endpoint, connection are made through dedicated network.
  - access public service in any region.


Direct Connect Gateway:
  - with direct we connect to resource in the same region.
  - with direct connect gateway we can connect to other region except china.
  - connect to any vpc in any region.
  - vpc cannot have overlap CIDR block.

VPC Peering:
=================

- VPC peering is used to connect private network from one VPC or one subnet to another VPC.
- sharing internal resource via private ip address.
- vpc peering can occur between vpc in same or different region.
- we can configure vpc peering betwween vpc in two different accounts.
- to peer vpc , they must have separate CIDR block range.
- transitive connection are not allowed.
- can configure to peering the entire vpc or just subnet.
