Bucket permissions:
=======================

need to explore
 S3 IAM and Bucket Policies
  S3 IAM and Bucket Policies examples

- Bucket based Policies
    - resource based Policy [buckets, ec2]
    - JSON file attached to the resources
    - can grant access to other account or other IAM Users
    - policy limited to 20 kb in size.
    ACL
      - use of both bucket and objects
      - grant read/write permission to other aws accounts.
      - cannot grant conditional permissions
      - explicitly deny permissions
      - use xml format
      - if u r not owner of the bucket, using ACL you can control access to the objects.
    IAM
      - user Policy

- user based Policies

By default owner of bucket has full permission.
Other account upload object into buckets, will own that object. Bucket owner cannot access that object.
Bucket owner can archeive any object.


Create User:
Iam -> Users -> enter the user name and create.

Attach policy to the user:
Iam -> Policy -> create policy
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:Get*",
                "s3:List*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}

Iam -> User -> select the user name -> permission -> attach the existing policy
                                    -> Security credentials  -> Manage password -> autogenerated -> download "credentials.csv"
                                        - credentials.csv will have sign on link and password & user name.
                                        - Use the sign on link to login in different browser
                                        - try to upload any file, it will fail becaz that user will have only read acess.
