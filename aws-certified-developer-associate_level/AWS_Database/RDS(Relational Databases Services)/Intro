RDS:
- Amazon will take care of database service and we can just use it.
- no need of maintenance from user end.
- no need of license. hourly cost includes the license cost.
- fully managed databse services
- ability to scale on demand. for scaling storge no need to restart whereas for
- can enable multi AZ deployment for backup and highly available.
- utilize read replicas (has primary and secondary. if primary fails use secondary)
- oltp database.
- supported dbs:
     - mysql , mariadb, postgresql, oracle, sql server , aurora(amazon's own db).
     - aurora
          - mysql or postgresql compatible
          - features
             - continuous backup
             - upto 15 read replicas across 3 AZs
             - replication lag of single digit milliseconds.
             - backtrack in seconds.
             - multi-master option.
      - amazon aurora serverless
          - autoscaling
          - use the db as you go
          - no management of cluster or instances
          - scales to zero if you are not Using
          - pay as you go.
          - pay only for the storage.
- advantage
    - automatic upgrade, backup, recovery
    - multi-az

RDS Backups:
=============
- automated point in time backups agains rds database
- automated backups are deleted once the db instance is deleted and cannot be recovered
- max retention period of automated snapshot is 35 days
- manual snapshot can be retained as long as we want
- snapshot can be copied to other region for disaster recovery.
- snapshot are automatically encrypted.

Read replicas:
==============
- asynchronous copies of primary database that are used of read only purpose.
- when we write new data to primary db, then aws copies it for us in read replica.
- you can create , and have multiple read replica for primary db.
- cross-region replica are supported
- mysql, mariadb , postgresql and aurora currently supports read replicas.
- monitor replication lag using cloudwatch.

Multi AZ failover:
===================
- automatic az failover synchronously replicates the data to a backup db instance located in another availability zone(but in same region)
- In the event of
    - service outage on az , primary db failure, manual failover initiated, updating software aws will automatically switch
      DNS record from the primary instance to the stand-by instance.
- rds backup is taken from stand by instance to reduce IO freeze and slow down if multi az is enabled.
- in order for multi az to work, launch the primary db in "subnet groups"
