CloudFront:
=============
- Its a (CDN) content delivery network service. Delivers the content from the edge location instead of from origin.
- Docs are cached and next time we request, it will get the docs from the edge location where docs are cached.
- Cloudfront distribution (web or RTMP)
  - define origin for content.
  - integrate with route 53 for alternate CNAME
  - cache behaviour
    - path pattern ( images/*.jpg)
    - min, max , default ttl
    - query string forwarding and caching
    - HTTP methods.
- Updating Cached files:
  - caching is done based off the cache keys
  - in order to serve the new version of the object , either create new object with new name or create an "invalidation" on the CloudFront
    distribution based on the object name.
  - "invalidation" can be costly.
  - set TTL=0

CloudFront Origin:
  - "origin" location is the source of the Content
  - origin can be s3, elb , any http endpoint.
  - live video streaming
  - rtmp distribution (flash media files)
  - data trasfer from s3 to cloudfront is free.

CloudFront Security :
======================
- SSL certificate
- END to END HTTPS
- AWS WAF integration
- Distribute private Content
  - S3
    - Limit access to Origin Access Identity
  - Signed URL or Signed cookie
    - Expiration
    - Restrict by IP
    - Trusted Signers
- GeoRestriction

CloudFront Performance:
=========================

- Regional caches
  - Save content ejected from cache close to edge location
- Point entire domain to Cloudfront to speed up dynamic Content
  - connection optimization
  - dynamic objects are still cached.

- Cloudfront performance can still be affected by
  - file size and type of files
  - having to remake the request from edge location to origin.
    - download the object from origin will take time.
    - as well as writing it to cache and respond to the user.
    - more request to origin, higher the load on your source.
  - Query strings reduce cache "hits"
    - it reduce the performance because query strings are often unique so it reduces the cache hits and also requires extra "work" in order
      to forward to the origin location.

- Cloudfront performance can be increased by:
  - longer cache period will increase the performance.
