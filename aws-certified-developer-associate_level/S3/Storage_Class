Storage Classes:
=================

standard
  - designed for general , all purpose
  - default storage option
  - 99.99% durability and availability.
  - most expensive storage Classes

Infrequent Access(S3-IA):
  - designed for objects that are not frequently accessed.
  - less expensive than standard
  - 99.99% durability
  - 99.9% availability.
  - 30 days minimum charge if we store the data in this storage class.

One Zone Infrequent Access(S3 One Zone-IA):
  - designed for non-critical and reproducible objects.
  - less expensive than above two.
  - 99.99% durability
  - 99.5% availability.
  - 30 day minimum charge if we store the data in this storage class.

Glacier:(separate storage service)
  - designed for long term archival storage
  - may take several hours for object stored in glacier to be retrieved.
  - cheapest storage class of all.
  - 99.99% durability
  - 90 days minimum charge if we store the data in this storage class.
  - we can transfer data from s3 to glacier.
  - from s3 we cannot download the object stored in glacier.
  - we need to restore if we want to download from s3.

When storage cost decrease , access cost increase.


Lifecycle Policies:
=====================
set of rules that automate the migration of data between storage class.
by default lifecyle policies are disabled.

S3 Event Notifications:
========================
allow to setup automated communication between S3 and other aws services when a selected event occurs at in an S3 bucket.
common trigger Notifications include:
  - ObjectCreated
     - Put , Post, copy
  - ObjectRemoved

Event Notifications can be sent to following services:
  - sns
