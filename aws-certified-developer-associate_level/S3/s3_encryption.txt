Data protection using encryption:
===================================

Data in-transit:
-------------------
  - using ssl or client side encryption.
  client -> encryption -> s3 -> save to disk

Method 1:(client side encryption)
  - using an AWS KMS(key managed system)-managed customer master key(CMK). Client get unique encryption key for each object.
  - On Upload
     - client send request to aws KMS for a key.
     - AWS KMS returns an encryption key.(plain text for encryption & ciphor blob to upload to s3 as object metadata)
  - On Download
     - Client download encrypted object from s3 with the ciphor blob stored in the metadata.
     - client send the cipher blob to AWS KMS to get the plain text.
     - plain text is used to decrypt the data.

Method 2:(client side master key)
  - using a client side master key. Master keys and unencrypted data are never sent to aws.
  - On upload
     - client provides master key to s3 encryption client.
     - s3 client generates a random data key and encryptes with master key.
     - s3 client encyptes data using data key and upload description as part of object metadata.
  - On Download
     - client download encrypted object with metadata.
     - metadata tells which master key to use to decrypt.
     - using master key , client decrypts the data key.
     - that datakey  is used to decrypt the object.

Data at rest:
------------------
  - request s3 to encrypt the objects.
  client -> s3 -> encryption -> save to disk

  - s3 provides server side encryption while saving data to disk.
  - add "x-amz-server-side-encryption" request header to upload request.
  - uses "AES-256" (Advanced Encryption Standard)

  - Also, we can use KMS- managed encryption keys and customer provided encryption keys.


Setup encryption for the object:
=====================================

While uploading files into the S3, in Properties -> Encryption -> select Amazon S3 master Key

Server Side Encryption:
========================
- S3 encryption (AES-256)
- SSE-S3  -> S3 managed encryption keys
- SSE-C   -> customer provided encryption keys
- SSE-KMS -> S3 uses master keys in KMS
