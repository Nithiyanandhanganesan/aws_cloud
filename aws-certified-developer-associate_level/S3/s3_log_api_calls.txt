Logging api calls:
=======================

Many people uses the aws resource. We need to track who accessed the what resource.
We can store the logs in S3 buckets.


CloudTrail:
==============

With CloudTrail, you can view events for your AWS account. Create a trail to retain a record of these events. With a trail, you can also create event metrics, trigger alerts, and create event workflows.


Steps to create CloudTrail:
================================

- Create Tail.
- Enter the required information
- Click "Create"


Select the "Event History" and see the recent events.
Logs will also be placed the buckets created in the CloudTrail.
All the events happened in the aws will be tracked.
It may take ~5 minutes to update the events in CloudTrail.

It Logs only the bucket action not the object action.
To see the object action, we need to use Server Access logs.

Server access Logs:
=====================

- Select the Buckets -> Properties -> Server Access Logging -> Enable Logging -> Save

It will take 1 hour ,to place the server access logs into that bucket.
