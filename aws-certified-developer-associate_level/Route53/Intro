Route 53:
========
- Route 53 is a DNS service.
- from the browser , it request the DNS server with the domain name and in return DNS will give the IP address of the host.
- Route 53 runs across the world in the edge node.
- It's a domain management service(DNS) provided by AWS.
- Features:
  - Domain Registration:
    - Register the domain names such as nithiy.com
  - Domain Name System service
    - translate the domain names into ip addresses
    - responds to DNS queries using a global network of authoritative DNS servers which reduces latency.
  - Health checking
    - sends automatic request over the internet to application to verify its reachable, available, functional.

- Manage external DNS for domain routing. eg: routing the request from nithiy.com to s3, cloudfront, EC2
- Its commonly used to ELB to distribute the traffic from domain to ELB
- Also used to manage internal DNS for custom internal hostnames within a VPC as long as VPC is configured for it.
- Latency, failover policy allow region-to-region fault tolerance Architecture design.
- easily configure failover for S3


Route 53 Hosted Zones:
=======================

- Hosted zones stores dns records for your domain.
- it contains all the rules that tells route 53 what to do with the DNS request.
- types of hosted Zones
  - public hosted zones is a container that holds information about how you want to route the traffic on the internet for a domain.
  - private hosted zones is a container that holds information about how you want to route the traffic for a domain and its subdomain within
    one or more Amazon VPC.
- after create the hosted zones for your domain, create resource record sets to tell DNS how you want traffic to be routed for that domain.
- Hosted zone come with pre-populated with NS and SOA(start of authority) record sets.

Route 53 Record Sets:
======================
- Match domain names with IP addresses
- comprised of various options
  - record Types
  - standard/alias
  - routing policy
  - evaluate target health

- Common record type include
   - A: point domain to IPV4
   - AAAA: point domain to IPV6
   - CNAME: point host name to another host
   - MX: used to route email.

- Alias Record sets
  - instead of an ip address, alias record sets contain pointer to the AWS specific resource such as:
    - ELB, Cloudfront, Elastic Beanstalk, S3 for static website.

- Routing Policy
  - Simple : route traffic to one endpoints
  - Weighted: route traffic to multiple Endpoints
  - Latency : route traffic to end point based on the user latency to various Endpoints
  - Failover : route traffic to "secondary" endpoint when "primary" is not available.
  - Geolocation: route traffic to endpoint based on the geo location.

- Evaluate health check


Route 53 for DNS Failover:
===========================

- By using failover routing policy in a Route 53 DNS record set, S3 bucket can be used as a failover endpoint.
- though s3 is used as static web hosting, it will provide some information to user that site is down.
- For DNS record to use the S3 bucket as an endpoint, bucket name must be same as the domain name.
