Reduced Redundancy Storage:
  - more likely to loose objects
  - low cost
  - use only for non critical Data

-> Open S3 -> Upload image -> right click image -> properties -> Storage Class -> select "reduced Redundancy"


To automate the process , i.e when user uploads image automatically change the storage to reduced Redundancy, we are going to use Lambda.

Lambda -> Create new function
