EMR:
- Simplifies big data processing (hadoop, spark) on aws.
- processing large dataset in batches.

Feature:
- S3 for storage
   - load into hdfs or keep in S3(EMRFS)
- transient cluster
   - scale up or down based on the data
   - once the job completes, cluster terminates itself.
   - pay only for the time cluster is active.
- SPOT instances
- Bootstrapping
   - customized startup configuration.


Cluster :
   - it has master node and slave node.
   - master node
       - job submitted to the master node
       - it launch the task in slave node.
       - we have access only to master node.
       -
   - slave node
      - two types of slave nodes
          - task nodes
             - software component which run only tasks
             - its optional.
             - its will use hdfs storage.
             - to be used if only processing is high.
             - we can scale by adding more task nodes to the cluster and terminate when its not required.
          - core nodes
             - has software component which run tasks and stores data in hdfs
             - it deals with the heavy lifting of the data
             - atleast one core node is required for the Cluster
             - consists of cpu and memory
